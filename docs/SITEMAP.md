## Implementation status

The keyword lists above are planning references.

Every page in the registry is prerendered at build time to its own HTML file with its title, description, canonical, Open Graph tags and JSON-LD.
Calculator pages carry `WebApplication` and `BreadcrumbList` schema.
The homepage carries `CollectionPage` and `ItemList` schema.
`sitemap.xml` and `robots.txt` are generated from the registry during the build.
`public/og-image.png` is the default social image.
Head tags use React 19 metadata, not React Helmet.
`tests/seo/` checks the registry, the prerendered HTML, the sitemap and hydration.

## Canonical URLs

All pages use `https://khatakit.in` as the canonical base:
```html
<link rel="canonical" href="https://khatakit.in/emi-calculator" />
```
