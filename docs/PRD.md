## V1 Tools

### 1. GST Late Fee & Interest Calculator

**Purpose:** Calculate penalties for late filing of GST returns.

**Inputs:**
- Return type (GSTR-3B, GSTR-1 / IFF, GSTR-9)
- Due date
- Actual filing date
- Tax paid in cash (GSTR-3B only)
- Aggregate turnover slab
- Whether it's a nil return
- Turnover in the State or Union territory (GSTR-9 only)

**Calculation Logic:**

**Late Fee (Section 47 CGST Act):**
- GSTR-3B non-nil: Rs. 50/day (Rs. 25 CGST + Rs. 25 SGST)
- GSTR-3B nil return: Rs. 20/day (Rs. 10 CGST + Rs. 10 SGST)
- Late fee caps based on turnover:
  - Turnover up to Rs. 1.5 Cr: Max Rs. 2,000
  - Turnover Rs. 1.5 Cr to Rs. 5 Cr: Max Rs. 5,000
  - Turnover above Rs. 5 Cr: Max Rs. 10,000
- Nil return cap: Rs. 500
- GSTR-1 uses the same amounts (Notification 20/2021)
- GSTR-9 (Notification 07/2023): Rs. 50, 100 or 200/day by turnover, capped at 0.04% or 0.5% of State turnover

**Interest (Section 50 CGST Act):**
- Rate: 18% per annum
- Formula: `Tax Liability * 18/100 * (Days Late / 365)`
- Applied on tax paid in cash

**Output:**
- Late fee breakdown (CGST + SGST)
- Interest amount
- Total penalty
- Dated workings and CSV download

| Rs. 16,00,001 - 20,00,000 | 20% |
| Rs. 20,00,001 - 24,00,000 | 25% |
| Above Rs. 24,00,000 | 30% |

Standard deduction: Rs. 75,000 (salaried/pension)

Rebate under section 156 (old 87A): Up to Rs. 60,000 (income up to Rs. 12,00,000; marginal relief up to Rs. 12,75,000)

Where:
- P = Principal loan amount
- R = Monthly interest rate (annual rate / 12 / 100)
- N = Total number of months

**Output:**
- Monthly EMI amount
- Total interest payable
- Total amount payable (principal + interest)
