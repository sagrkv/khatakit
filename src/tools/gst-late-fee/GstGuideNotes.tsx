      <GuideSection title="Edge cases">
        <ul>
          <li>
            <strong>Nil return.</strong> A nil GSTR-3B (no tax payable) or a nil GSTR-1 (no outward
            supplies) costs ₹20 a day, up to ₹500 in total. A nil GSTR-3B carries no interest.
          </li>
          <li>
            <strong>Caps.</strong> A regular GSTR-3B or GSTR-1 stops at ₹2,000 for aggregate
            turnover up to ₹1.5 crore in the previous year, and ₹5,000 up to ₹5 crore. Above ₹5
            crore, section 47(1) caps it at ₹10,000.
          </li>
          <li>
            <strong>Filing on the due date.</strong> Nothing is payable for a return filed on the
            due date. Counting starts the next day.
          </li>
          <li>
            <strong>GSTR-9 turnover.</strong> The daily fee depends on aggregate turnover for the
            year of the return, across all registrations under the same PAN. The cap is a share of
            turnover in the State of the registration, entered in Turnover in this State.
          </li>
          <li>
            <strong>Interest only on cash paid.</strong> For a late GSTR-3B, interest is charged on
            tax paid from the electronic cash ledger, not on tax paid from input tax credit. If the
            return is filed after proceedings under section 73, 74 or 74A have started, interest is
            on the full tax. This calculator does not cover that case.
          </li>
          <li>
            <strong>Three-year limit.</strong> The GST portal does not accept a return more than
            three years after its due date, from the July 2025 tax period. The calculator warns
            when the filing date is past that limit.
          </li>
