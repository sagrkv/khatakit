            <strong>The 5% cash condition.</strong> The ₹3 crore and ₹75 lakh limits need cash
            receipts of 5% or less of the total. Cash of 5.01% brings the limit back to ₹2 crore or
            ₹50 lakh.

            <strong>Cheques count as cash</strong> unless they are account payee cheques or drafts

          <li>
            <strong>Late bank receipts.</strong> The 6% rate needs payment by banking or online mode
            during the tax year or before the return due date. Later receipts are taxed at 8%.
          </li>
          <li>
            <strong>Advance tax.</strong> Presumptive filers pay the whole advance tax by 15 March
            2027, not in four instalments (section 408(2)).

          <li>
            <strong>Near ₹12 lakh.</strong> New regime income up to ₹12 lakh pays no tax. Just above
