      <GuideSection title="Calendar months or 30-day months">
        <p>
          The TRACES help page counts calendar months from the day after deduction to the date of
          deposit. Its example: deducted 10 June 2023 and deposited 8 August 2023 is 3 months.
        </p>
        <p>
          Several tribunal rulings, including UTI Mutual Fund v. DCIT (ITAT Mumbai, 2019), read a
          month as 30 days. The two methods differ when a period crosses a month end but is shorter
          than 30 days.
        </p>
        <p>
          Example: {formatRupees(late.amount)} deducted on{' '}
          {formatDisplayDate(ONE_DAY_LATE.input.deductedOn)} and deposited on{' '}
          {formatDisplayDate(ONE_DAY_LATE.input.depositedOn)}, one day after the due date. Calendar
          months count {compactMonths(late.lateDeposit!.months)}:{' '}
          {formatPaise(late.totalCalendarPaise)}. The {late.lateDeposit!.days} days are one 30-day
          month: {formatPaise(late.totalThirtyDayPaise)}.
        </p>
        <p>
          The calculator shows calendar months as the main answer, because TRACES demands use them.

          <li>
            March deductions are due by 30 April. {formatRupees(march.amount)} deducted on 20 March
            2026 and deposited on 5 May 2026 counts {compactMonths(march.lateDeposit!.months)}:{' '}

            Straddling 1 April 2026: the Act is chosen by the date tax became deductible. Tax
            deductible before 1 April 2026 stays under section 201(1A) of the 1961 Act, and its
            months are counted as one period. Section 536(2)(g) of the 2025 Act may apply section
            398 to the months from April 2026. The rates are the same, so the amount does not
            change.

            Not yet deposited, or not yet deducted: interest runs to the as-of date and is marked as

          <li>Part months: 1 day into a new month counts that whole month.</li>
          <li>Deducted on the last day of a month: that month is not counted for late deposit.</li>
          <li>Deducted before the date it was deductible: no late-deduction interest.</li>
          <li>An amount below ₹100 rounds down to 0, so its interest is 0.</li>
